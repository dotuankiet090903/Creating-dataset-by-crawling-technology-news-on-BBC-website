            "Source inputs (truncated if length < 1024): Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a \"significant move\" for Microsoft and the industry.The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought fo\n",

            "Source inputs (truncated if length < 1024): Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a \"significant move\" for Microsoft and the industry.The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought fo\n",

            "Source inputs (truncated if length < 1024): Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a \"significant move\" for Microsoft and the industry.The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought fo\n",

            "Source inputs (truncated if length < 1024): Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a \"significant move\" for Microsoft and the industry.The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought fo\n",

            "Source inputs (truncated if length < 1024): Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a \"significant move\" for Microsoft and the industry.The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought fo\n",
