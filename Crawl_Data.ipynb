In the same year it rebranded from Mindgeek to Aylo.  The IWF believes it has improved, and says annual \\\"actionable reports\\\" it has received of CSAM on Aylo owned sites have fallen to zero. It points to Aylo introducing new safeguards and \\\"expanding [its] moderation workforce and processes\\\". The company also uses some technologies provided by the IWF.Susie Hargreaves OBE, chief executive of the IWF, said the adult industry had billions of users worldwide and as such had a role to play \\\"in making sure the internet is a safe place\\\".Aylo's David Cooke said he was proud of the work with the IWF.\\\"We have made significant, ground-breaking advancements in Trust and Safety measures across our platforms, and we aren\\u2019t slowing down.\\\"But others were unimpressed - Michael Bowe, a lawyer involved in action against the company on behalf of dozens of women relating to incidents prior to 2023, told the BBC that experience had made him sceptical of its claims about moderation processes: \\\"One more announcement doesn't mean much\\\", he said.\",\n          \"Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.
